📦 App Name (Working Title): All Our Jars

📝 Description

All Our Jars is a visual and intelligent catalogue app for movie enthusiasts — especially those who collect physical media formats like LaserDiscs, VHS, DVDs, and Blu-rays. Designed for retro collectors, the app helps users easily archive, browse, and manage their media library from any device.

The app scrapes metadata from trusted online databases (such as TMDb, LDDB, and Blu-ray.com) and organizes collections by format, genre, and custom tags. It also includes AI-powered metadata generation and manual entry options for obscure or unlisted items.

🔧 Key Features

Automatic Metadata Scraping
Retrieves cover art, title, year, director, cast, and genres from external databases (TMDb, LDDB, Blu-ray.com, etc.).

AI Fallback (Optional)
If no data is found, the app can use AI to auto-generate metadata as a backup — title, genres, description, and more.

Manual Metadata Input
Users can fully customize or enter metadata themselves, giving control over niche or personal items.

Multi-Category Filtering
Dynamic genre filtering works like Netflix — instantly re-categorize your collection by Romance, Action, Drama, etc.

Storage Location Tracking
Assign and search by physical location (e.g., “Attic box B2” or “Shelf 3, binder page 4”).

Resale Value Field
Add or estimate current resale value per item, great for insurance, trade, or valuation purposes.

Barcode Scanning Support
Scan UPC/EAN barcodes from physical media to auto-fetch or match entries.

Catalog Number Support
Search or input LaserDisc or VHS-specific identifiers (e.g., LDV-13007) for deeper database matching.

Image Uploads (Future Feature)
Users can submit custom cover photos for items not found in databases, gradually building a community-driven media index.
